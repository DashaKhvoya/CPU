# CPU
It is a processor that works with assembly code.
We have three separate programs: Assembler.cpp (translates our text into assembler code), Counter.cpp (works with assembler code), 
Disassembler.cpp (translates assembler code into text, it is only needed to test the work of Assembler.cpp). 
Commands.h contains all our commands. To add a new command, it is enough to add it only in commands.h and everything will work. 
Also, our processor has RAM and video memory (we can draw a circle using the circle.txt file). 
Also, using the files QuadEq.txt, Fib.txt and Fact.txt, we can display the number of the solution to a quadratic equation and the solutions themselves,
the k-th Fibbonacci number or factorial of the number. 
(with the help of assembler, we will convert text files into assembly code and then run the binaries on our processor).
